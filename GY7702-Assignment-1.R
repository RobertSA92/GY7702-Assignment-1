# Question 1 --------------------------------------------------------------


# Create a vector of  25 numbers between 1 and 7 using the function c.

survey_answers <- c(NA, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2, 4, NA, 6, 3, 5, 4, 0, 5, 7, 5, NA, 5, 2, 4, NA, 3, 3, 5, NA)



# These values represent the answers to a survey question, the scale is as follows:

# 1 = completely disagree
# 2 = disagree
# 3 = somehow disagree
# 4 = neither agree nor disagree
# 5 = somehow agree
# 6 = agree
# 7 = completely agree
# NA = missing value


# Question 1.1 ------------------------------------------------------------


  
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)


    
# Remove all NA values from vector
 cleaned_survey_answers <- survey_answers[!is.na(survey_answers)]
    
    # Check if all survey answers completely disagree
    if(all(cleaned_survey_answers == 1)) {
      cat("All survey answers completely disagree")
     
       
    # Check if all survey answers compleely agree
    } else {
    if(all(cleaned_survey_answers == 7)) {  
      cat("All survey answers completely agree")
      
      
    # If all answers neither completely disagree or completeyly agree give this output
    } else {
      cat("All survey answers neither completely disagree or completely agree")
  }
}
    

    
# Question 1.2 ------------------------------------------------------------

    

# Coerce data into logical values, any values that equal 5 or greater are TRUE, any values that equal 4 or lower are FALSE.
# This uses the original data with the NA values in order to find the original index of each survey answer. 

 logical_original_survey_answers <- survey_answers >= 5

 
# Find the indexes that are TRUE

# Question 3.4  -----------------------------------------------------------


# The number of new cases starts to rise in the second week of March but quickly lowers back to 0
  # after 4 days. 
# An increase can be observed later in March, this time with sustained percentage changes
  # often between 100 - 200%. 
# The lower figures that interrupt this sustained change tend to be Sunday and Monday recordings.
# The number of new cases continues at a high rate into May, 
# reaching a percentage change high of 800% on May 10th. 
# From here, the number of new cases declines. 
# In June, July, and the first week of August there are very few new cases, 
  # although there is a notable spike of 10 new cases on July 20th. 
# New cases begin to climb again from the 2nd half of August, 
  # with percentage change often equalling between 100 - 300%.
# The figures remain similar to this through to October 9th, where this data ends.

# The aim of this analysis is to compare the development of Covid cases in Powys
# with other areas in the United Kingdom that have a similar population count. 
# According to Local Authority Data the area of Powys has a population of 132531. 
# To find other regions with a similar population, the data was filtered for areas 
# with a population between +1000 and -1000 that of Powys. 
# The areas found by this process were Epping Forest, Exeter, Stratford-on-Avon, 
# and Tonbridge and Malling (Table 1.)

# Data recording the daily number of new Covid cases was then analysed for each area.  
# The results showed a fall in cases on Sunday and Monday,
# to mitigate this weekend factor, and attain a better understanding of general trends, 
# a 7-day average of new cases was calculated for each week.

# 5 of the first 6 weeks show the number of new cases in Powys increasing, 
# reaching a high of 6.71 in mid-April.  
# The 4 other areas show a similar pattern, reaching their highest number of new cases
# either in April, or at the very end of March.
# From here, all areas begin to decline, Powys reaches a low of 0.14 at the start of June 
# and sustains a value of less than 1 every week until the end of July. 
# Similarly, all other areas reach low values in July or the latter half of June. 
# From here, the number of new cases grows in every area until the data ends in October (Table 2).    



# Table will illustrate a comparison between Powys and 4 other regions that have similar populations.
# To understand the general trends and mitigate the weekend effect a 7 day average of new cases has been 
# calculated for each week. Broadland spike. Epping Forest spike.
# High finish. 

# Notes -------------------------------------------------------------------


 #ISO week 
 
 # Breakdown into week summaries
 # Compare with other areas with similar population sizes
 # Can I introduce new data?
 # print width?
 # small population table?
 # possibly use pivot?
 # include densities and area?
 # wales lockdown?
 # isoweek?
 # find a way of filling na values with 0 instead of filtering them out
